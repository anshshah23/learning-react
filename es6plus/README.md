# ES6+ Features in React

This repository contains examples demonstrating the use of modern JavaScript (ES6+) features in React applications.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They are particularly useful for defining methods and callbacks in React components.

**File:** `ArrowFunctionExample.jsx`
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const ArrowFunctionExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ArrowFunctionExample;
```

## Classes

Classes are used to define stateful components in React. Although hooks are now more common, understanding class components is still valuable.

**File:** `ClassComponentExample.jsx`
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ClassComponentExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponentExample;
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects, making your code more readable and concise.

**File:** `DestructuringExample.jsx`
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const DestructuringExample = ({ initialCount }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DestructuringExample;
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
4. Run the project using `yarn start`.

Explore each example to understand how these ES6+ features are used in React.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
